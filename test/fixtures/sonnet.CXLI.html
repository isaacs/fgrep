<BLOCKQUOTE>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,<BR>
For they in thee a thousand errors note;<BR>
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,<BR>
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;<BR>
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,<BR>
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,<BR>
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<BR>
To any sensual feast with thee alone:<BR>
But my five wits nor my five senses can<BR>
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<BR>
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,<BR>
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:<BR>
  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,<BR>
  That she that makes me sin awards me pain.<BR>
