<BLOCKQUOTE>Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,<BR>
With my extern the outward honouring,<BR>
Or laid great bases for eternity,<BR>
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?<BR>
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour<BR>
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,<BR>
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,<BR>
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?<BR>
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,<BR>
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,<BR>
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,<BR>
But mutual render, only me for thee.<BR>
  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul<BR>
  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.<BR>
