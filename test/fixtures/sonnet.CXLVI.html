<BLOCKQUOTE>Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,<BR>
[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;<BR>
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<BR>
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<BR>
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<BR>
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<BR>
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<BR>
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?<BR>
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,<BR>
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<BR>
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<BR>
Within be fed, without be rich no more:<BR>
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<BR>
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.<BR>
