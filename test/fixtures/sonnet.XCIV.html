<BLOCKQUOTE>They that have power to hurt and will do none,<BR>
That do not do the thing they most do show,<BR>
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,<BR>
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,<BR>
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces<BR>
And husband nature's riches from expense;<BR>
They are the lords and owners of their faces,<BR>
Others but stewards of their excellence.<BR>
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,<BR>
Though to itself it only live and die,<BR>
But if that flower with base infection meet,<BR>
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:<BR>
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<BR>
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.<BR>
