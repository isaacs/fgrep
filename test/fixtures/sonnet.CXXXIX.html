<BLOCKQUOTE>O, call not me to justify the wrong<BR>
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;<BR>
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;<BR>
Use power with power and slay me not by art.<BR>
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,<BR>
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:<BR>
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might<BR>
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?<BR>
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows<BR>
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,<BR>
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,<BR>
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:<BR>
  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,<BR>
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.<BR>
