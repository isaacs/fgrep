<BLOCKQUOTE>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest<BR>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<BR>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest<BR>
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.<BR>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:<BR>
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:<BR>
If all were minded so, the times should cease<BR>
And threescore year would make the world away.<BR>
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,<BR>
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:<BR>
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;<BR>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<BR>
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby<BR>
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<BR>
