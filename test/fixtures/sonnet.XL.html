<BLOCKQUOTE>Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;<BR>
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<BR>
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;<BR>
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.<BR>
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,<BR>
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;<BR>
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest<BR>
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.<BR>
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,<BR>
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;<BR>
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief<BR>
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.<BR>
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,<BR>
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.<BR>
