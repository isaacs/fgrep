<BLOCKQUOTE>I never saw that you did painting need<BR>
And therefore to your fair no painting set;<BR>
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed<BR>
The barren tender of a poet's debt;<BR>
And therefore have I slept in your report,<BR>
That you yourself being extant well might show<BR>
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<BR>
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<BR>
This silence for my sin you did impute,<BR>
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;<BR>
For I impair not beauty being mute,<BR>
When others would give life and bring a tomb.<BR>
  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes<BR>
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.<BR>
