<BLOCKQUOTE>As a decrepit father takes delight<BR>
To see his active child do deeds of youth,<BR>
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,<BR>
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.<BR>
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,<BR>
Or any of these all, or all, or more,<BR>
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,<BR>
I make my love engrafted to this store:<BR>
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,<BR>
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give<BR>
That I in thy abundance am sufficed<BR>
And by a part of all thy glory live.<BR>
  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:<BR>
  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!<BR>
