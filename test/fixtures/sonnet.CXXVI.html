<BLOCKQUOTE>O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power<BR>
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;<BR>
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st<BR>
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;<BR>
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,<BR>
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,<BR>
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill<BR>
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.<BR>
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!<BR>
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:<BR>
  Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,<BR>
  And her quietus is to render thee.<BR>
