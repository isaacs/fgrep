<BLOCKQUOTE>The forward violet thus did I chide:<BR>
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,<BR>
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride<BR>
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells<BR>
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.<BR>
The lily I condemned for thy hand,<BR>
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:<BR>
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,<BR>
One blushing shame, another white despair;<BR>
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both<BR>
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;<BR>
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth<BR>
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.<BR>
  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see<BR>
  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.<BR>
