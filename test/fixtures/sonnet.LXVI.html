<BLOCKQUOTE>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,<BR>
As, to behold desert a beggar born,<BR>
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<BR>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<BR>
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,<BR>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<BR>
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<BR>
And strength by limping sway disabled,<BR>
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<BR>
And folly doctor-like controlling skill,<BR>
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<BR>
And captive good attending captain ill:<BR>
  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,<BR>
  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.<BR>
