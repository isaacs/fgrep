<BLOCKQUOTE>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend<BR>
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?<BR>
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,<BR>
And being frank she lends to those are free.<BR>
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse<BR>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<BR>
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use<BR>
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<BR>
For having traffic with thyself alone,<BR>
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.<BR>
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,<BR>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<BR>
  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,<BR>
  Which, used, lives th' executor to be.<BR>
