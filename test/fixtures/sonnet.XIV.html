<BLOCKQUOTE>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;<BR>
And yet methinks I have astronomy,<BR>
But not to tell of good or evil luck,<BR>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;<BR>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<BR>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<BR>
Or say with princes if it shall go well,<BR>
By oft predict that I in heaven find:<BR>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<BR>
And, constant stars, in them I read such art<BR>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,<BR>
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;<BR>
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<BR>
  Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.<BR>
