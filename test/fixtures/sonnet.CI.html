<BLOCKQUOTE>O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends<BR>
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?<BR>
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;<BR>
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.<BR>
Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say<BR>
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;<BR>
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;<BR>
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'<BR>
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<BR>
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee<BR>
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,<BR>
And to be praised of ages yet to be.<BR>
  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how<BR>
  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.<BR>
