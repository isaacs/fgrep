<BLOCKQUOTE>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,<BR>
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:<BR>
The better angel is a man right fair,<BR>
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.<BR>
To win me soon to hell, my female evil<BR>
Tempteth my better angel from my side,<BR>
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,<BR>
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.<BR>
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend<BR>
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;<BR>
But being both from me, both to each friend,<BR>
I guess one angel in another's hell:<BR>
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,<BR>
  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.<BR>
