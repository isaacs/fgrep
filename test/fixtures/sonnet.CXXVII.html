<BLOCKQUOTE>In the old age black was not counted fair,<BR>
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;<BR>
But now is black beauty's successive heir,<BR>
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:<BR>
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,<BR>
Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,<BR>
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,<BR>
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.<BR>
Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,<BR>
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem<BR>
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,<BR>
Slandering creation with a false esteem:<BR>
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,<BR>
  That every tongue says beauty should look so.<BR>
