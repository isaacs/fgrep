<BLOCKQUOTE>The expense of spirit in a waste of shame<BR>
Is lust in action; and till action, lust<BR>
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,<BR>
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,<BR>
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,<BR>
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had<BR>
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait<BR>
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;<BR>
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;<BR>
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;<BR>
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;<BR>
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.<BR>
  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well<BR>
  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.<BR>
