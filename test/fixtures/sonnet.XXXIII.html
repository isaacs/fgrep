<BLOCKQUOTE>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<BR>
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,<BR>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<BR>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<BR>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<BR>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<BR>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<BR>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<BR>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine<BR>
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;<BR>
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;<BR>
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.<BR>
  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<BR>
  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.<BR>
