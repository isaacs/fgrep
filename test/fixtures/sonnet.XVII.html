<BLOCKQUOTE>Who will believe my verse in time to come,<BR>
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?<BR>
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb<BR>
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.<BR>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes<BR>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<BR>
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:<BR>
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'<BR>
So should my papers yellow'd with their age<BR>
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,<BR>
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage<BR>
And stretched metre of an antique song:<BR>
  But were some child of yours alive that time,<BR>
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.<BR>
