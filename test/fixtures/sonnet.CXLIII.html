<BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch<BR>
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,<BR>
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch<BR>
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,<BR>
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<BR>
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent<BR>
To follow that which flies before her face,<BR>
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;<BR>
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,<BR>
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;<BR>
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,<BR>
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:<BR>
  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'<BR>
  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.<BR>
