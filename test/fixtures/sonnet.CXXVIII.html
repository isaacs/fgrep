<BLOCKQUOTE>How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,<BR>
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds<BR>
With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st<BR>
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,<BR>
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap<BR>
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,<BR>
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,<BR>
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!<BR>
To be so tickled, they would change their state<BR>
And situation with those dancing chips,<BR>
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,<BR>
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.<BR>
  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,<BR>
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.<BR>
