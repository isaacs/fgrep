<BLOCKQUOTE>If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,<BR>
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'<BR>
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;<BR>
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.<BR>
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<BR>
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<BR>
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<BR>
Among a number one is reckon'd none:<BR>
Then in the number let me pass untold,<BR>
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;<BR>
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<BR>
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:<BR>
  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<BR>
  And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'<BR>
