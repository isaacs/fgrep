<BLOCKQUOTE>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<BR>
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,<BR>
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<BR>
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<BR>
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out<BR>
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,<BR>
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,<BR>
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?<BR>
O fearful meditation! where, alack,<BR>
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?<BR>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?<BR>
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<BR>
  O, none, unless this miracle have might,<BR>
  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.<BR>
