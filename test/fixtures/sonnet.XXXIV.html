<BLOCKQUOTE>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,<BR>
And make me travel forth without my cloak,<BR>
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,<BR>
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?<BR>
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<BR>
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<BR>
For no man well of such a salve can speak<BR>
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:<BR>
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;<BR>
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:<BR>
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief<BR>
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.<BR>
  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,<BR>
  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.<BR>
