<BLOCKQUOTE>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,<BR>
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,<BR>
Have put on black and loving mourners be,<BR>
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.<BR>
And truly not the morning sun of heaven<BR>
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,<BR>
Nor that full star that ushers in the even<BR>
Doth half that glory to the sober west,<BR>
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:<BR>
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart<BR>
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,<BR>
And suit thy pity like in every part.<BR>
  Then will I swear beauty herself is black<BR>
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.<BR>
