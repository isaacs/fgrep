<BLOCKQUOTE>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<BR>
And each doth good turns now unto the other:<BR>
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,<BR>
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,<BR>
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast<BR>
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;<BR>
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest<BR>
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:<BR>
So, either by thy picture or my love,<BR>
Thyself away art resent still with me;<BR>
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<BR>
And I am still with them and they with thee;<BR>
  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<BR>
  Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.<BR>
