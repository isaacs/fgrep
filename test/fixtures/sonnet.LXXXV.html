<BLOCKQUOTE>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,<BR>
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,<BR>
Reserve their character with golden quill<BR>
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<BR>
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,<BR>
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'<BR>
To every hymn that able spirit affords<BR>
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.<BR>
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'<BR>
And to the most of praise add something more;<BR>
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,<BR>
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.<BR>
  Then others for the breath of words respect,<BR>
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.<BR>
