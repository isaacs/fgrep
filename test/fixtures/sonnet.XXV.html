<BLOCKQUOTE>Let those who are in favour with their stars<BR>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<BR>
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,<BR>
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.<BR>
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread<BR>
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,<BR>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<BR>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<BR>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<BR>
After a thousand victories once foil'd,<BR>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<BR>
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:<BR>
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved<BR>
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.<BR>
