<BLOCKQUOTE>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all<BR>
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,<BR>
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,<BR>
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;<BR>
That I have frequent been with unknown minds<BR>
And given to time your own dear-purchased right<BR>
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds<BR>
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.<BR>
Book both my wilfulness and errors down<BR>
And on just proof surmise accumulate;<BR>
Bring me within the level of your frown,<BR>
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;<BR>
  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove<BR>
  The constancy and virtue of your love.<BR>
