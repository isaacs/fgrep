<BLOCKQUOTE>O, lest the world should task you to recite<BR>
What merit lived in me, that you should love<BR>
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,<BR>
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;<BR>
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<BR>
To do more for me than mine own desert,<BR>
And hang more praise upon deceased I<BR>
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<BR>
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,<BR>
That you for love speak well of me untrue,<BR>
My name be buried where my body is,<BR>
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.<BR>
  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<BR>
  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.<BR>
