<BLOCKQUOTE>Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,<BR>
And with his presence grace impiety,<BR>
That sin by him advantage should achieve<BR>
And lace itself with his society?<BR>
Why should false painting imitate his cheek<BR>
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?<BR>
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek<BR>
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?<BR>
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,<BR>
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?<BR>
For she hath no exchequer now but his,<BR>
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.<BR>
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had<BR>
  In days long since, before these last so bad.<BR>
