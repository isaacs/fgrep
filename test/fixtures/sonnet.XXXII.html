<BLOCKQUOTE>If thou survive my well-contented day,<BR>
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,<BR>
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<BR>
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,<BR>
Compare them with the bettering of the time,<BR>
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,<BR>
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<BR>
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<BR>
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<BR>
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,<BR>
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<BR>
To march in ranks of better equipage:<BR>
  But since he died and poets better prove,<BR>
  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'<BR>
