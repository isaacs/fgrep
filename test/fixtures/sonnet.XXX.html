<BLOCKQUOTE>When to the sessions of sweet silent thought<BR>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<BR>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<BR>
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<BR>
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<BR>
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<BR>
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,<BR>
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:<BR>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<BR>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<BR>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<BR>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<BR>
  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<BR>
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.<BR>
