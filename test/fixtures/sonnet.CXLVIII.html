<BLOCKQUOTE>O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,<BR>
Which have no correspondence with true sight!<BR>
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,<BR>
That censures falsely what they see aright?<BR>
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,<BR>
What means the world to say it is not so?<BR>
If it be not, then love doth well denote<BR>
Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'<BR>
How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,<BR>
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?<BR>
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;<BR>
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.<BR>
  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,<BR>
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.<BR>
