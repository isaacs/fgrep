<BLOCKQUOTE>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;<BR>
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,<BR>
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,<BR>
And do not drop in for an after-loss:<BR>
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,<BR>
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;<BR>
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<BR>
To linger out a purposed overthrow.<BR>
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,<BR>
When other petty griefs have done their spite<BR>
But in the onset come; so shall I taste<BR>
At first the very worst of fortune's might,<BR>
  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,<BR>
  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.<BR>
