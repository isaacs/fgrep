<BLOCKQUOTE>So am I as the rich, whose blessed key<BR>
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,<BR>
The which he will not every hour survey,<BR>
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.<BR>
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,<BR>
Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,<BR>
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,<BR>
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.<BR>
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,<BR>
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,<BR>
To make some special instant special blest,<BR>
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.<BR>
  Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,<BR>
  Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.<BR>
