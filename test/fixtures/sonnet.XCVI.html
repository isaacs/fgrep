<BLOCKQUOTE>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<BR>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<BR>
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;<BR>
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.<BR>
As on the finger of a throned queen<BR>
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,<BR>
So are those errors that in thee are seen<BR>
To truths translated and for true things deem'd.<BR>
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,<BR>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<BR>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<BR>
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<BR>
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort<BR>
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<BR>
