<BLOCKQUOTE>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,<BR>
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,<BR>
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,<BR>
Still losing when I saw myself to win!<BR>
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,<BR>
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<BR>
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted<BR>
In the distraction of this madding fever!<BR>
O benefit of ill! now I find true<BR>
That better is by evil still made better;<BR>
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,<BR>
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.<BR>
  So I return rebuked to my content<BR>
  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.<BR>
