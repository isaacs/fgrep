<BLOCKQUOTE>How can I then return in happy plight,<BR>
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?<BR>
When day's oppression is not eased by night,<BR>
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?<BR>
And each, though enemies to either's reign,<BR>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;<BR>
The one by toil, the other to complain<BR>
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.<BR>
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright<BR>
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<BR>
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,<BR>
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.<BR>
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer<BR>
  And night doth nightly make grief's strength<BR>
  	seem stronger.<BR>
