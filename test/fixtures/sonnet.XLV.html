<BLOCKQUOTE>The other two, slight air and purging fire,<BR>
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;<BR>
The first my thought, the other my desire,<BR>
These present-absent with swift motion slide.<BR>
For when these quicker elements are gone<BR>
In tender embassy of love to thee,<BR>
My life, being made of four, with two alone<BR>
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;<BR>
Until life's composition be recured<BR>
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,<BR>
Who even but now come back again, assured<BR>
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:<BR>
  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,<BR>
  I send them back again and straight grow sad.<BR>
