<BLOCKQUOTE>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,<BR>
And I will comment upon that offence;<BR>
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,<BR>
Against thy reasons making no defence.<BR>
Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,<BR>
To set a form upon desired change,<BR>
As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,<BR>
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,<BR>
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue<BR>
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,<BR>
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong<BR>
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.<BR>
  For thee against myself I'll vow debate,<BR>
  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.<BR>
