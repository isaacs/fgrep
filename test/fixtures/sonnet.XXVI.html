<BLOCKQUOTE>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<BR>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<BR>
To thee I send this written embassage,<BR>
To witness duty, not to show my wit:<BR>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<BR>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<BR>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<BR>
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;<BR>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving<BR>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect<BR>
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,<BR>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<BR>
  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<BR>
  Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<BR>
