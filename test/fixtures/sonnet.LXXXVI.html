<BLOCKQUOTE>Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<BR>
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,<BR>
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<BR>
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<BR>
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write<BR>
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<BR>
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<BR>
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<BR>
He, nor that affable familiar ghost<BR>
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence<BR>
As victors of my silence cannot boast;<BR>
I was not sick of any fear from thence:<BR>
  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,<BR>
  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.<BR>
