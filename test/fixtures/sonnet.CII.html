<BLOCKQUOTE>My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;<BR>
I love not less, though less the show appear:<BR>
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming<BR>
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.<BR>
Our love was new and then but in the spring<BR>
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,<BR>
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing<BR>
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:<BR>
Not that the summer is less pleasant now<BR>
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<BR>
But that wild music burthens every bough<BR>
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<BR>
  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,<BR>
  Because I would not dull you with my song.<BR>
