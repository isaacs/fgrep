<BLOCKQUOTE>Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,<BR>
When I against myself with thee partake?<BR>
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot<BR>
Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?<BR>
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?<BR>
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?<BR>
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend<BR>
Revenge upon myself with present moan?<BR>
What merit do I in myself respect,<BR>
That is so proud thy service to despise,<BR>
When all my best doth worship thy defect,<BR>
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?<BR>
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;<BR>
  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.<BR>
