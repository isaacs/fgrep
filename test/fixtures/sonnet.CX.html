<BLOCKQUOTE>Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there<BR>
And made myself a motley to the view,<BR>
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<BR>
Made old offences of affections new;<BR>
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth<BR>
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,<BR>
These blenches gave my heart another youth,<BR>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.<BR>
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:<BR>
Mine appetite I never more will grind<BR>
On newer proof, to try an older friend,<BR>
A god in love, to whom I am confined.<BR>
  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<BR>
  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.<BR>
