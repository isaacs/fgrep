<BLOCKQUOTE>Let not my love be call'd idolatry,<BR>
Nor my beloved as an idol show,<BR>
Since all alike my songs and praises be<BR>
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.<BR>
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<BR>
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;<BR>
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,<BR>
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.<BR>
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,<BR>
'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;<BR>
And in this change is my invention spent,<BR>
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.<BR>
  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,<BR>
  Which three till now never kept seat in one.<BR>
