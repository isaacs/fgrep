<BLOCKQUOTE>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,<BR>
So do our minutes hasten to their end;<BR>
Each changing place with that which goes before,<BR>
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<BR>
Nativity, once in the main of light,<BR>
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,<BR>
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,<BR>
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<BR>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<BR>
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,<BR>
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,<BR>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<BR>
  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,<BR>
  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.<BR>
