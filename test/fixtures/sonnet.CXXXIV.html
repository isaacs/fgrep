<BLOCKQUOTE>So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,<BR>
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,<BR>
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine<BR>
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:<BR>
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,<BR>
For thou art covetous and he is kind;<BR>
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me<BR>
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.<BR>
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,<BR>
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,<BR>
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;<BR>
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.<BR>
  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:<BR>
  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.<BR>
