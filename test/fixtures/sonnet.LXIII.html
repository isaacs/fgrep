<BLOCKQUOTE>Against my love shall be, as I am now,<BR>
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;<BR>
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow<BR>
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn<BR>
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,<BR>
And all those beauties whereof now he's king<BR>
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,<BR>
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;<BR>
For such a time do I now fortify<BR>
Against confounding age's cruel knife,<BR>
That he shall never cut from memory<BR>
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:<BR>
  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,<BR>
  And they shall live, and he in them still green.<BR>
