<BLOCKQUOTE>So is it not with me as with that Muse<BR>
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,<BR>
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<BR>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse<BR>
Making a couplement of proud compare,<BR>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,<BR>
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare<BR>
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.<BR>
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,<BR>
And then believe me, my love is as fair<BR>
As any mother's child, though not so bright<BR>
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:<BR>
  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;<BR>
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<BR>
