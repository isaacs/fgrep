<BLOCKQUOTE>O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are<BR>
No longer yours than you yourself here live:<BR>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<BR>
And your sweet semblance to some other give.<BR>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<BR>
Find no determination: then you were<BR>
Yourself again after yourself's decease,<BR>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<BR>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<BR>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold<BR>
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<BR>
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<BR>
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know<BR>
  You had a father: let your son say so.<BR>
