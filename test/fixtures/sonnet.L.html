<BLOCKQUOTE>How heavy do I journey on the way,<BR>
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,<BR>
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say<BR>
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'<BR>
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<BR>
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<BR>
As if by some instinct the wretch did know<BR>
His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:<BR>
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on<BR>
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;<BR>
Which heavily he answers with a groan,<BR>
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;<BR>
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;<BR>
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.<BR>
