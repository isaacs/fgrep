<BLOCKQUOTE>Is it thy will thy image should keep open<BR>
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?<BR>
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,<BR>
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?<BR>
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee<BR>
So far from home into my deeds to pry,<BR>
To find out shames and idle hours in me,<BR>
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?<BR>
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:<BR>
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;<BR>
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,<BR>
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:<BR>
  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,<BR>
  From me far off, with others all too near.<BR>
