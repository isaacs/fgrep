<BLOCKQUOTE>Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long<BR>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<BR>
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<BR>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<BR>
Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem<BR>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;<BR>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem<BR>
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<BR>
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,<BR>
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;<BR>
If any, be a satire to decay,<BR>
And make Time's spoils despised every where.<BR>
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;<BR>
  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.<BR>
