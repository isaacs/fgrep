<BLOCKQUOTE>As an unperfect actor on the stage<BR>
Who with his fear is put besides his part,<BR>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<BR>
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.<BR>
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say<BR>
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,<BR>
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,<BR>
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.<BR>
O, let my books be then the eloquence<BR>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<BR>
Who plead for love and look for recompense<BR>
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.<BR>
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:<BR>
  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.<BR>
