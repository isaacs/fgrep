<BLOCKQUOTE>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'<BR>
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;<BR>
More than enough am I that vex thee still,<BR>
To thy sweet will making addition thus.<BR>
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<BR>
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<BR>
Shall will in others seem right gracious,<BR>
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<BR>
The sea all water, yet receives rain still<BR>
And in abundance addeth to his store;<BR>
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'<BR>
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.<BR>
  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<BR>
  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'<BR>
