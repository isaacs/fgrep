<BLOCKQUOTE>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<BR>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;<BR>
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,<BR>
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.<BR>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<BR>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<BR>
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know<BR>
Time's thievish progress to eternity.<BR>
Look, what thy memory can not contain<BR>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<BR>
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,<BR>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<BR>
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<BR>
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.<BR>
