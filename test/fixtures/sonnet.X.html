<BLOCKQUOTE>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,<BR>
Who for thyself art so unprovident.<BR>
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<BR>
But that thou none lovest is most evident;<BR>
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate<BR>
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.<BR>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<BR>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.<BR>
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!<BR>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<BR>
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,<BR>
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:<BR>
  Make thee another self, for love of me,<BR>
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<BR>
