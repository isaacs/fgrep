<BLOCKQUOTE>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<BR>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<BR>
Will play the tyrants to the very same<BR>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:<BR>
For never-resting time leads summer on<BR>
To hideous winter and confounds him there;<BR>
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<BR>
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:<BR>
Then, were not summer's distillation left,<BR>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<BR>
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<BR>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:<BR>
  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,<BR>
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.<BR>
