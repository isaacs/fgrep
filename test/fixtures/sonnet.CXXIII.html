<BLOCKQUOTE>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:<BR>
Thy pyramids built up with newer might<BR>
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;<BR>
They are but dressings of a former sight.<BR>
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire<BR>
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,<BR>
And rather make them born to our desire<BR>
Than think that we before have heard them told.<BR>
Thy registers and thee I both defy,<BR>
Not wondering at the present nor the past,<BR>
For thy records and what we see doth lie,<BR>
Made more or less by thy continual haste.<BR>
  This I do vow and this shall ever be;<BR>
  I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.<BR>
