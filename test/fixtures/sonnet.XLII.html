<BLOCKQUOTE>That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,<BR>
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;<BR>
That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,<BR>
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.<BR>
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:<BR>
Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;<BR>
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<BR>
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.<BR>
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,<BR>
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;<BR>
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<BR>
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:<BR>
  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;<BR>
  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.<BR>
