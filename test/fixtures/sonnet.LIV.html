<BLOCKQUOTE>O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<BR>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!<BR>
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<BR>
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.<BR>
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye<BR>
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<BR>
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly<BR>
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:<BR>
But, for their virtue only is their show,<BR>
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,<BR>
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;<BR>
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:<BR>
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<BR>
  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.<BR>
