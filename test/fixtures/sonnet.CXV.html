<BLOCKQUOTE>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,<BR>
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:<BR>
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why<BR>
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.<BR>
But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents<BR>
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,<BR>
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,<BR>
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;<BR>
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,<BR>
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'<BR>
When I was certain o'er incertainty,<BR>
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?<BR>
  Love is a babe; then might I not say so,<BR>
  To give full growth to that which still doth grow?<BR>
