<BLOCKQUOTE>Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<BR>
Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,<BR>
Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,<BR>
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;<BR>
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<BR>
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:<BR>
But these particulars are not my measure;<BR>
All these I better in one general best.<BR>
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<BR>
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,<BR>
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;<BR>
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:<BR>
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take<BR>
  All this away and me most wretched make.<BR>
