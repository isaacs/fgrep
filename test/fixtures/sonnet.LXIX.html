<BLOCKQUOTE>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view<BR>
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;<BR>
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,<BR>
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.<BR>
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;<BR>
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own<BR>
In other accents do this praise confound<BR>
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.<BR>
They look into the beauty of thy mind,<BR>
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;<BR>
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,<BR>
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:<BR>
  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,<BR>
  The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.<BR>
