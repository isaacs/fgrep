<BLOCKQUOTE>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<BR>
Injurious distance should not stop my way;<BR>
For then despite of space I would be brought,<BR>
From limits far remote where thou dost stay.<BR>
No matter then although my foot did stand<BR>
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;<BR>
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land<BR>
As soon as think the place where he would be.<BR>
But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,<BR>
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<BR>
But that so much of earth and water wrought<BR>
I must attend time's leisure with my moan,<BR>
  Receiving nought by elements so slow<BR>
  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.<BR>
