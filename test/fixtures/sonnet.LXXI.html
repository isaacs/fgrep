<BLOCKQUOTE>No longer mourn for me when I am dead<BR>
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell<BR>
Give warning to the world that I am fled<BR>
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:<BR>
Nay, if you read this line, remember not<BR>
The hand that writ it; for I love you so<BR>
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot<BR>
If thinking on me then should make you woe.<BR>
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse<BR>
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,<BR>
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.<BR>
But let your love even with my life decay,<BR>
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan<BR>
  And mock you with me after I am gone.<BR>
