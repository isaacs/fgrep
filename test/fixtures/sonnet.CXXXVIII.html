<BLOCKQUOTE>When my love swears that she is made of truth<BR>
I do believe her, though I know she lies,<BR>
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,<BR>
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.<BR>
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<BR>
Although she knows my days are past the best,<BR>
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:<BR>
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.<BR>
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?<BR>
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<BR>
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,<BR>
And age in love loves not to have years told:<BR>
  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,<BR>
  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.<BR>
