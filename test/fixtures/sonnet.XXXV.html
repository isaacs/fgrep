<BLOCKQUOTE>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:<BR>
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;<BR>
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<BR>
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<BR>
All men make faults, and even I in this,<BR>
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<BR>
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,<BR>
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;<BR>
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--<BR>
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--<BR>
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:<BR>
Such civil war is in my love and hate<BR>
  That I an accessary needs must be<BR>
  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.<BR>
