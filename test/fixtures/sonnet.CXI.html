<BLOCKQUOTE>O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,<BR>
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,<BR>
That did not better for my life provide<BR>
Than public means which public manners breeds.<BR>
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,<BR>
And almost thence my nature is subdued<BR>
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:<BR>
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;<BR>
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink<BR>
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection<BR>
No bitterness that I will bitter think,<BR>
Nor double penance, to correct correction.<BR>
  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye<BR>
  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.<BR>
