<BLOCKQUOTE>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,<BR>
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,<BR>
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,<BR>
And all those friends which I thought buried.<BR>
How many a holy and obsequious tear<BR>
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye<BR>
As interest of the dead, which now appear<BR>
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!<BR>
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<BR>
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<BR>
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;<BR>
That due of many now is thine alone:<BR>
  Their images I loved I view in thee,<BR>
  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.<BR>
