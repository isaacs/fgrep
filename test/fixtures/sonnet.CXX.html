<BLOCKQUOTE>That you were once unkind befriends me now,<BR>
And for that sorrow which I then did feel<BR>
Needs must I under my transgression bow,<BR>
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.<BR>
For if you were by my unkindness shaken<BR>
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,<BR>
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken<BR>
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.<BR>
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd<BR>
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,<BR>
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd<BR>
The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!<BR>
  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;<BR>
  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.<BR>
