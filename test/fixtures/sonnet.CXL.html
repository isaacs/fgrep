<BLOCKQUOTE>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press<BR>
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;<BR>
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express<BR>
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.<BR>
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,<BR>
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;<BR>
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,<BR>
No news but health from their physicians know;<BR>
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,<BR>
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:<BR>
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,<BR>
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,<BR>
  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,<BR>
  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.<BR>
