<BLOCKQUOTE>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,<BR>
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;<BR>
From hence your memory death cannot take,<BR>
Although in me each part will be forgotten.<BR>
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<BR>
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:<BR>
The earth can yield me but a common grave,<BR>
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.<BR>
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<BR>
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,<BR>
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse<BR>
When all the breathers of this world are dead;<BR>
  You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--<BR>
  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.<BR>
