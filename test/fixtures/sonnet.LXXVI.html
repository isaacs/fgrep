<BLOCKQUOTE>Why is my verse so barren of new pride,<BR>
So far from variation or quick change?<BR>
Why with the time do I not glance aside<BR>
To new-found methods and to compounds strange?<BR>
Why write I still all one, ever the same,<BR>
And keep invention in a noted weed,<BR>
That every word doth almost tell my name,<BR>
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?<BR>
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,<BR>
And you and love are still my argument;<BR>
So all my best is dressing old words new,<BR>
Spending again what is already spent:<BR>
  For as the sun is daily new and old,<BR>
  So is my love still telling what is told.<BR>
