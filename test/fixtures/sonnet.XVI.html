<BLOCKQUOTE>But wherefore do not you a mightier way<BR>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<BR>
And fortify yourself in your decay<BR>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<BR>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<BR>
And many maiden gardens yet unset<BR>
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,<BR>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<BR>
So should the lines of life that life repair,<BR>
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,<BR>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<BR>
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.<BR>
  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,<BR>
  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.<BR>
