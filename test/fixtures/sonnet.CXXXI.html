<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,<BR>
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;<BR>
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart<BR>
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.<BR>
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold<BR>
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:<BR>
To say they err I dare not be so bold,<BR>
Although I swear it to myself alone.<BR>
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,<BR>
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,<BR>
One on another's neck, do witness bear<BR>
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.<BR>
  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,<BR>
  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.<BR>
