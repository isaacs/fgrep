<BLOCKQUOTE>O, from what power hast thou this powerful might<BR>
With insufficiency my heart to sway?<BR>
To make me give the lie to my true sight,<BR>
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?<BR>
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,<BR>
That in the very refuse of thy deeds<BR>
There is such strength and warrantize of skill<BR>
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?<BR>
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more<BR>
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?<BR>
O, though I love what others do abhor,<BR>
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:<BR>
  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,<BR>
  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.<BR>
