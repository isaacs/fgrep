<BLOCKQUOTE>That time of year thou mayst in me behold<BR>
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<BR>
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<BR>
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<BR>
In me thou seest the twilight of such day<BR>
As after sunset fadeth in the west,<BR>
Which by and by black night doth take away,<BR>
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.<BR>
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire<BR>
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<BR>
As the death-bed whereon it must expire<BR>
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.<BR>
  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,<BR>
  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.<BR>
