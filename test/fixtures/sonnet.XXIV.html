<BLOCKQUOTE>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd<BR>
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;<BR>
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,<BR>
And perspective it is the painter's art.<BR>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<BR>
To find where your true image pictured lies;<BR>
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<BR>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<BR>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<BR>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<BR>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<BR>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<BR>
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;<BR>
  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<BR>
