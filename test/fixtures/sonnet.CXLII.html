<BLOCKQUOTE>Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,<BR>
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:<BR>
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,<BR>
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;<BR>
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,<BR>
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments<BR>
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,<BR>
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.<BR>
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those<BR>
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:<BR>
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows<BR>
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<BR>
  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<BR>
  By self-example mayst thou be denied!<BR>
