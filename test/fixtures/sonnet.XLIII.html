<BLOCKQUOTE>When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,<BR>
For all the day they view things unrespected;<BR>
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<BR>
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.<BR>
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,<BR>
How would thy shadow's form form happy show<BR>
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<BR>
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<BR>
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made<BR>
By looking on thee in the living day,<BR>
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<BR>
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<BR>
  All days are nights to see till I see thee,<BR>
  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.<BR>
