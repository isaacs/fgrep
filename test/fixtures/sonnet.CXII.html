<BLOCKQUOTE>Your love and pity doth the impression fill<BR>
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;<BR>
For what care I who calls me well or ill,<BR>
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?<BR>
You are my all the world, and I must strive<BR>
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:<BR>
None else to me, nor I to none alive,<BR>
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.<BR>
In so profound abysm I throw all care<BR>
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense<BR>
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.<BR>
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:<BR>
  You are so strongly in my purpose bred<BR>
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.<BR>
