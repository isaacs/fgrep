<BLOCKQUOTE>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan<BR>
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!<BR>
Is't not enough to torture me alone,<BR>
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?<BR>
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,<BR>
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:<BR>
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;<BR>
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.<BR>
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,<BR>
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;<BR>
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;<BR>
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:<BR>
  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,<BR>
  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.<BR>
