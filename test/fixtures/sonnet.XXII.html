<BLOCKQUOTE>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<BR>
So long as youth and thou are of one date;<BR>
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<BR>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<BR>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee<BR>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<BR>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<BR>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<BR>
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary<BR>
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<BR>
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<BR>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<BR>
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;<BR>
  Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.<BR>
