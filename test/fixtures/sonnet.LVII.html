<BLOCKQUOTE>Being your slave, what should I do but tend<BR>
Upon the hours and times of your desire?<BR>
I have no precious time at all to spend,<BR>
Nor services to do, till you require.<BR>
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour<BR>
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,<BR>
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour<BR>
When you have bid your servant once adieu;<BR>
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought<BR>
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<BR>
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought<BR>
Save, where you are how happy you make those.<BR>
  So true a fool is love that in your will,<BR>
  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.<BR>
