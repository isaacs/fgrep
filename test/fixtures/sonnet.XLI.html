<BLOCKQUOTE>Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,<BR>
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,<BR>
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,<BR>
For still temptation follows where thou art.<BR>
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,<BR>
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;<BR>
And when a woman woos, what woman's son<BR>
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?<BR>
Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,<BR>
And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,<BR>
Who lead thee in their riot even there<BR>
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,<BR>
  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,<BR>
  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.<BR>
