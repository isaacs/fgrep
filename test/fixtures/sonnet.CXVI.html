<BLOCKQUOTE>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<BR>
Admit impediments. Love is not love<BR>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<BR>
Or bends with the remover to remove:<BR>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<BR>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<BR>
It is the star to every wandering bark,<BR>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<BR>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<BR>
Within his bending sickle's compass come:<BR>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<BR>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<BR>
  If this be error and upon me proved,<BR>
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<BR>
