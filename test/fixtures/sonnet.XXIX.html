<BODY><H1>Sonnet XXIX</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,<BR>
I all alone beweep my outcast state<BR>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries<BR>
And look upon myself and curse my fate,<BR>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<BR>
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,<BR>
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,<BR>
With what I most enjoy contented least;<BR>
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,<BR>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<BR>
Like to the lark at break of day arising<BR>
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<BR>
  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings<BR>
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<BR>
