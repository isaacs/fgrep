<BLOCKQUOTE>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<BR>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.<BR>
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,<BR>
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?<BR>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<BR>
By unions married, do offend thine ear,<BR>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<BR>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.<BR>
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<BR>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,<BR>
Resembling sire and child and happy mother<BR>
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<BR>
  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,<BR>
  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'<BR>
