<BLOCKQUOTE>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse<BR>
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook<BR>
The dedicated words which writers use<BR>
Of their fair subject, blessing every book<BR>
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,<BR>
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,<BR>
And therefore art enforced to seek anew<BR>
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days<BR>
And do so, love; yet when they have devised<BR>
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,<BR>
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized<BR>
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;<BR>
  And their gross painting might be better used<BR>
  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.<BR>
