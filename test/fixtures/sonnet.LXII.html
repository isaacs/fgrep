<BLOCKQUOTE>Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye<BR>
And all my soul and all my every part;<BR>
And for this sin there is no remedy,<BR>
It is so grounded inward in my heart.<BR>
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,<BR>
No shape so true, no truth of such account;<BR>
And for myself mine own worth do define,<BR>
As I all other in all worths surmount.<BR>
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,<BR>
Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,<BR>
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;<BR>
Self so self-loving were iniquity.<BR>
  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,<BR>
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.<BR>
