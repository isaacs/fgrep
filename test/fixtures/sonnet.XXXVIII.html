<BLOCKQUOTE>How can my Muse want subject to invent,<BR>
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse<BR>
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent<BR>
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<BR>
O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me<BR>
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<BR>
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,<BR>
When thou thyself dost give invention light?<BR>
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<BR>
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<BR>
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<BR>
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<BR>
  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,<BR>
  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.<BR>
