<BLOCKQUOTE>That god forbid that made me first your slave,<BR>
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,<BR>
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,<BR>
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!<BR>
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,<BR>
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;<BR>
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,<BR>
Without accusing you of injury.<BR>
Be where you list, your charter is so strong<BR>
That you yourself may privilege your time<BR>
To what you will; to you it doth belong<BR>
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.<BR>
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;<BR>
  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.<BR>
