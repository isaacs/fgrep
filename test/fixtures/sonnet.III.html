<BLOCKQUOTE>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest<BR>
Now is the time that face should form another;<BR>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<BR>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<BR>
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb<BR>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<BR>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<BR>
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?<BR>
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<BR>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:<BR>
So thou through windows of thine age shall see<BR>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<BR>
  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,<BR>
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.<BR>
