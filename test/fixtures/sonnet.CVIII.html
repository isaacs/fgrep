<BLOCKQUOTE>What's in the brain that ink may character<BR>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?<BR>
What's new to speak, what new to register,<BR>
That may express my love or thy dear merit?<BR>
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,<BR>
I must, each day say o'er the very same,<BR>
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<BR>
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.<BR>
So that eternal love in love's fresh case<BR>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<BR>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<BR>
But makes antiquity for aye his page,<BR>
  Finding the first conceit of love there bred<BR>
  Where time and outward form would show it dead.<BR>
