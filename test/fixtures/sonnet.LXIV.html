<BLOCKQUOTE>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced<BR>
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;<BR>
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed<BR>
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;<BR>
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<BR>
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<BR>
And the firm soil win of the watery main,<BR>
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;<BR>
When I have seen such interchange of state,<BR>
Or state itself confounded to decay;<BR>
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,<BR>
That Time will come and take my love away.<BR>
  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose<BR>
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.<BR>
