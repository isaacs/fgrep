<BLOCKQUOTE>'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,<BR>
When not to be receives reproach of being,<BR>
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd<BR>
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:<BR>
For why should others false adulterate eyes<BR>
Give salutation to my sportive blood?<BR>
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,<BR>
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?<BR>
No, I am that I am, and they that level<BR>
At my abuses reckon up their own:<BR>
I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;<BR>
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;<BR>
  Unless this general evil they maintain,<BR>
  All men are bad, and in their badness reign.<BR>
