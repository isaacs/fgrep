<BLOCKQUOTE>O, how I faint when I of you do write,<BR>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<BR>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<BR>
To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!<BR>
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,<BR>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<BR>
My saucy bark inferior far to his<BR>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<BR>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<BR>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;<BR>
Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,<BR>
He of tall building and of goodly pride:<BR>
  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<BR>
  The worst was this; my love was my decay.<BR>
