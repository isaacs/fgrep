<BLOCKQUOTE>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said<BR>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<BR>
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,<BR>
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:<BR>
So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill<BR>
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,<BR>
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<BR>
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.<BR>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<BR>
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new<BR>
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see<BR>
Return of love, more blest may be the view;<BR>
  Else call it winter, which being full of care<BR>
  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.<BR>
