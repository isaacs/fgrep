<BLOCKQUOTE>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame<BR>
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,<BR>
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!<BR>
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!<BR>
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,<BR>
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,<BR>
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;<BR>
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.<BR>
O, what a mansion have those vices got<BR>
Which for their habitation chose out thee,<BR>
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,<BR>
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!<BR>
  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;<BR>
  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.<BR>
