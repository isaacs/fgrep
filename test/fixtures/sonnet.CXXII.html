<BLOCKQUOTE>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain<BR>
Full character'd with lasting memory,<BR>
Which shall above that idle rank remain<BR>
Beyond all date, even to eternity;<BR>
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart<BR>
Have faculty by nature to subsist;<BR>
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part<BR>
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.<BR>
That poor retention could not so much hold,<BR>
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;<BR>
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,<BR>
To trust those tables that receive thee more:<BR>
  To keep an adjunct to remember thee<BR>
  Were to import forgetfulness in me.<BR>
