<BLOCKQUOTE>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light<BR>
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<BR>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<BR>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;<BR>
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,<BR>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<BR>
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<BR>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;<BR>
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,<BR>
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,<BR>
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are<BR>
From his low tract and look another way:<BR>
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,<BR>
  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.<BR>
