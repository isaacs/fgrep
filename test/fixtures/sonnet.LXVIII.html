<BLOCKQUOTE>Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<BR>
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<BR>
Before the bastard signs of fair were born,<BR>
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;<BR>
Before the golden tresses of the dead,<BR>
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<BR>
To live a second life on second head;<BR>
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:<BR>
In him those holy antique hours are seen,<BR>
Without all ornament, itself and true,<BR>
Making no summer of another's green,<BR>
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;<BR>
  And him as for a map doth Nature store,<BR>
  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.<BR>
