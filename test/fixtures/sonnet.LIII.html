<BLOCKQUOTE>What is your substance, whereof are you made,<BR>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<BR>
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,<BR>
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.<BR>
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit<BR>
Is poorly imitated after you;<BR>
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,<BR>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:<BR>
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;<BR>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<BR>
The other as your bounty doth appear;<BR>
And you in every blessed shape we know.<BR>
  In all external grace you have some part,<BR>
  But you like none, none you, for constant heart.<BR>
