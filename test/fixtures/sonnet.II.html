<BLOCKQUOTE>When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,<BR>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<BR>
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,<BR>
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:<BR>
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,<BR>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,<BR>
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,<BR>
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.<BR>
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<BR>
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<BR>
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'<BR>
Proving his beauty by succession thine!<BR>
  This were to be new made when thou art old,<BR>
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<BR>
