<BLOCKQUOTE>If there be nothing new, but that which is<BR>
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,<BR>
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss<BR>
The second burden of a former child!<BR>
O, that record could with a backward look,<BR>
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,<BR>
Show me your image in some antique book,<BR>
Since mind at first in character was done!<BR>
That I might see what the old world could say<BR>
To this composed wonder of your frame;<BR>
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,<BR>
Or whether revolution be the same.<BR>
  O, sure I am, the wits of former days<BR>
  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.<BR>
