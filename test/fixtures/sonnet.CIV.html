<BLOCKQUOTE>To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<BR>
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,<BR>
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold<BR>
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,<BR>
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd<BR>
In process of the seasons have I seen,<BR>
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,<BR>
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<BR>
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,<BR>
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;<BR>
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<BR>
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:<BR>
  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;<BR>
  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.<BR>
