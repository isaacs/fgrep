<BLOCKQUOTE>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;<BR>
And that which governs me to go about<BR>
Doth part his function and is partly blind,<BR>
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;<BR>
For it no form delivers to the heart<BR>
Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:<BR>
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,<BR>
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:<BR>
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,<BR>
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,<BR>
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,<BR>
The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:<BR>
  Incapable of more, replete with you,<BR>
  My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.<BR>
