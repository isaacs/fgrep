<BLOCKQUOTE>Those lips that Love's own hand did make<BR>
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'<BR>
To me that languish'd for her sake;<BR>
But when she saw my woeful state,<BR>
Straight in her heart did mercy come,<BR>
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet<BR>
Was used in giving gentle doom,<BR>
And taught it thus anew to greet:<BR>
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,<BR>
That follow'd it as gentle day<BR>
Doth follow night, who like a fiend<BR>
From heaven to hell is flown away;<BR>
  'I hate' from hate away she threw,<BR>
  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'<BR>
