<BLOCKQUOTE>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse<BR>
And found such fair assistance in my verse<BR>
As every alien pen hath got my use<BR>
And under thee their poesy disperse.<BR>
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing<BR>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly<BR>
Have added feathers to the learned's wing<BR>
And given grace a double majesty.<BR>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<BR>
Whose influence is thine and born of thee:<BR>
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,<BR>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;<BR>
  But thou art all my art and dost advance<BR>
  As high as learning my rude ignorance.<BR>
