<BLOCKQUOTE>Who is it that says most? which can say more<BR>
Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?<BR>
In whose confine immured is the store<BR>
Which should example where your equal grew.<BR>
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell<BR>
That to his subject lends not some small glory;<BR>
But he that writes of you, if he can tell<BR>
That you are you, so dignifies his story,<BR>
Let him but copy what in you is writ,<BR>
Not making worse what nature made so clear,<BR>
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,<BR>
Making his style admired every where.<BR>
  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,<BR>
  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.<BR>
