<BLOCKQUOTE>When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,<BR>
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<BR>
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,<BR>
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.<BR>
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<BR>
Upon thy part I can set down a story<BR>
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,<BR>
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:<BR>
And I by this will be a gainer too;<BR>
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<BR>
The injuries that to myself I do,<BR>
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.<BR>
  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<BR>
  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.<BR>
