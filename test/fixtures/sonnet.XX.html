<BLOCKQUOTE>A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted<BR>
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;<BR>
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted<BR>
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;<BR>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<BR>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<BR>
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,<BR>
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<BR>
And for a woman wert thou first created;<BR>
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<BR>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<BR>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<BR>
  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,<BR>
  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<BR>
