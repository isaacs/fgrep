<BLOCKQUOTE>Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,<BR>
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?<BR>
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,<BR>
And that your love taught it this alchemy,<BR>
To make of monsters and things indigest<BR>
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,<BR>
Creating every bad a perfect best,<BR>
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?<BR>
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,<BR>
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:<BR>
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,<BR>
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:<BR>
  If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin<BR>
  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.<BR>
