<BLOCKQUOTE>Like as, to make our appetites more keen,<BR>
With eager compounds we our palate urge,<BR>
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,<BR>
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,<BR>
Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,<BR>
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding<BR>
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness<BR>
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.<BR>
Thus policy in love, to anticipate<BR>
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured<BR>
And brought to medicine a healthful state<BR>
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:<BR>
  But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,<BR>
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.<BR>
