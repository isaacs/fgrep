<BLOCKQUOTE>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,<BR>
That they behold, and see not what they see?<BR>
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,<BR>
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.<BR>
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks<BR>
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,<BR>
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,<BR>
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?<BR>
Why should my heart think that a several plot<BR>
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?<BR>
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,<BR>
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?<BR>
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,<BR>
  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.<BR>
