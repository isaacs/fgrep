<BLOCKQUOTE>So are you to my thoughts as food to life,<BR>
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;<BR>
And for the peace of you I hold such strife<BR>
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;<BR>
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon<BR>
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,<BR>
Now counting best to be with you alone,<BR>
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;<BR>
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight<BR>
And by and by clean starved for a look;<BR>
Possessing or pursuing no delight,<BR>
Save what is had or must from you be took.<BR>
  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,<BR>
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.<BR>
