<BLOCKQUOTE>Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<BR>
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,<BR>
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd<BR>
And my sick Muse doth give another place.<BR>
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument<BR>
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,<BR>
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent<BR>
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.<BR>
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word<BR>
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give<BR>
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford<BR>
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.<BR>
  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,<BR>
  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.<BR>
