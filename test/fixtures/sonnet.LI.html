<BLOCKQUOTE>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence<BR>
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:<BR>
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?<BR>
Till I return, of posting is no need.<BR>
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,<BR>
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<BR>
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;<BR>
In winged speed no motion shall I know:<BR>
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;<BR>
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,<BR>
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;<BR>
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;<BR>
  Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,<BR>
  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.<BR>
