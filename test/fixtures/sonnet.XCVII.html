<BLOCKQUOTE>How like a winter hath my absence been<BR>
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<BR>
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<BR>
What old December's bareness every where!<BR>
And yet this time removed was summer's time,<BR>
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<BR>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<BR>
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<BR>
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me<BR>
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;<BR>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<BR>
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;<BR>
  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer<BR>
  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.<BR>
