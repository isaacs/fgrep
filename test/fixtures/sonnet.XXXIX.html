<BLOCKQUOTE>O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,<BR>
When thou art all the better part of me?<BR>
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?<BR>
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?<BR>
Even for this let us divided live,<BR>
And our dear love lose name of single one,<BR>
That by this separation I may give<BR>
That due to thee which thou deservest alone.<BR>
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,<BR>
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave<BR>
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<BR>
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,<BR>
  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<BR>
  By praising him here who doth hence remain!<BR>
