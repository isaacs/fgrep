<BLOCKQUOTE>But be contented: when that fell arrest<BR>
Without all bail shall carry me away,<BR>
My life hath in this line some interest,<BR>
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<BR>
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review<BR>
The very part was consecrate to thee:<BR>
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;<BR>
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:<BR>
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<BR>
The prey of worms, my body being dead,<BR>
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,<BR>
Too base of thee to be remembered.<BR>
  The worth of that is that which it contains,<BR>
  And that is this, and this with thee remains.<BR>
