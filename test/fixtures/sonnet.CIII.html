<BLOCKQUOTE>Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,<BR>
That having such a scope to show her pride,<BR>
The argument all bare is of more worth<BR>
Than when it hath my added praise beside!<BR>
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!<BR>
Look in your glass, and there appears a face<BR>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<BR>
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.<BR>
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,<BR>
To mar the subject that before was well?<BR>
For to no other pass my verses tend<BR>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;<BR>
  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit<BR>
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.<BR>
