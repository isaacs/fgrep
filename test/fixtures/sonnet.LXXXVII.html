<BLOCKQUOTE>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<BR>
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:<BR>
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<BR>
My bonds in thee are all determinate.<BR>
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<BR>
And for that riches where is my deserving?<BR>
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<BR>
And so my patent back again is swerving.<BR>
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,<BR>
Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;<BR>
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<BR>
Comes home again, on better judgment making.<BR>
  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,<BR>
  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.<BR>
