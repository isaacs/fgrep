<BLOCKQUOTE>From you have I been absent in the spring,<BR>
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim<BR>
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,<BR>
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.<BR>
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell<BR>
Of different flowers in odour and in hue<BR>
Could make me any summer's story tell,<BR>
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;<BR>
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,<BR>
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;<BR>
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,<BR>
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.<BR>
  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,<BR>
  As with your shadow I with these did play:<BR>
