<BLOCKQUOTE>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,<BR>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;<BR>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,<BR>
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;<BR>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,<BR>
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,<BR>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;<BR>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:<BR>
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,<BR>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;<BR>
Him in thy course untainted do allow<BR>
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.<BR>
  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,<BR>
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.<BR>
