<BLOCKQUOTE>My love is as a fever, longing still<BR>
For that which longer nurseth the disease,<BR>
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,<BR>
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.<BR>
My reason, the physician to my love,<BR>
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,<BR>
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve<BR>
Desire is death, which physic did except.<BR>
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,<BR>
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;<BR>
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,<BR>
At random from the truth vainly express'd;<BR>
  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,<BR>
  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.<BR>
