<BLOCKQUOTE>But do thy worst to steal thyself away,<BR>
For term of life thou art assured mine,<BR>
And life no longer than thy love will stay,<BR>
For it depends upon that love of thine.<BR>
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<BR>
When in the least of them my life hath end.<BR>
I see a better state to me belongs<BR>
Than that which on thy humour doth depend;<BR>
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<BR>
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.<BR>
O, what a happy title do I find,<BR>
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<BR>
  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?<BR>
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.<BR>
