<BODY><H1>Sonnet XLVIII</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>How careful was I, when I took my way,<BR>
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,<BR>
That to my use it might unused stay<BR>
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!<BR>
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,<BR>
Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,<BR>
Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,<BR>
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.<BR>
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,<BR>
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,<BR>
Within the gentle closure of my breast,<BR>
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;<BR>
  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,<BR>
  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.<BR>
