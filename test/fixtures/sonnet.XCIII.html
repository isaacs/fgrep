<BLOCKQUOTE>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<BR>
Like a deceived husband; so love's face<BR>
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;<BR>
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:<BR>
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<BR>
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.<BR>
In many's looks the false heart's history<BR>
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,<BR>
But heaven in thy creation did decree<BR>
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;<BR>
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,<BR>
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.<BR>
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,<BR>
  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!<BR>
