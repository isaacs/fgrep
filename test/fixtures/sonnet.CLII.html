<BLOCKQUOTE>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,<BR>
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,<BR>
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,<BR>
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.<BR>
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,<BR>
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;<BR>
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee<BR>
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,<BR>
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,<BR>
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,<BR>
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,<BR>
Or made them swear against the thing they see;<BR>
  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,<BR>
  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!<BR>
