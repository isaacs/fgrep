<BLOCKQUOTE>When in the chronicle of wasted time<BR>
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,<BR>
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme<BR>
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,<BR>
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,<BR>
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,<BR>
I see their antique pen would have express'd<BR>
Even such a beauty as you master now.<BR>
So all their praises are but prophecies<BR>
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;<BR>
And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,<BR>
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:<BR>
  For we, which now behold these present days,<BR>
  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.<BR>
