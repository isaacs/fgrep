<BLOCKQUOTE>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war<BR>
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;<BR>
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,<BR>
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.<BR>
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--<BR>
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--<BR>
But the defendant doth that plea deny<BR>
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<BR>
To 'cide this title is impanneled<BR>
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,<BR>
And by their verdict is determined<BR>
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:<BR>
  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,<BR>
  And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.<BR>
