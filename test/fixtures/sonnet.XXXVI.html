<BLOCKQUOTE>Let me confess that we two must be twain,<BR>
Although our undivided loves are one:<BR>
So shall those blots that do with me remain<BR>
Without thy help by me be borne alone.<BR>
In our two loves there is but one respect,<BR>
Though in our lives a separable spite,<BR>
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,<BR>
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.<BR>
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<BR>
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<BR>
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<BR>
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<BR>
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort<BR>
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<BR>
