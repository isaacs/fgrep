<BLOCKQUOTE>O, never say that I was false of heart,<BR>
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.<BR>
As easy might I from myself depart<BR>
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:<BR>
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,<BR>
Like him that travels I return again,<BR>
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<BR>
So that myself bring water for my stain.<BR>
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd<BR>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,<BR>
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,<BR>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;<BR>
  For nothing this wide universe I call,<BR>
  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.<BR>
