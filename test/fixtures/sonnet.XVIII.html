<BLOCKQUOTE>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<BR>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<BR>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<BR>
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<BR>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<BR>
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<BR>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<BR>
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;<BR>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade<BR>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<BR>
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<BR>
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<BR>
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<BR>
  So long lives this and this gives life to thee.<BR>
