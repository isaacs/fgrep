<H1>A Lover's Complaint</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded<BR>
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,<BR>
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<BR>
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;<BR>
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<BR>
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<BR>
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<BR>
Which fortified her visage from the sun,<BR>
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<BR>
The carcass of beauty spent and done:<BR>
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<BR>
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,<BR>
Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<BR>
Which on it had conceited characters,<BR>
Laundering the silken figures in the brine<BR>
That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,<BR>
And often reading what contents it bears;<BR>
As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,<BR>
In clamours of all size, both high and low.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,<BR>
As they did battery to the spheres intend;<BR>
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied<BR>
To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<BR>
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend<BR>
To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,<BR>
The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<BR>
Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride<BR>
For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,<BR>
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<BR>
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,<BR>
And true to bondage would not break from thence,<BR>
Though slackly braided in loose negligence.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A thousand favours from a maund she drew<BR>
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<BR>
Which one by one she in a river threw,<BR>
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;<BR>
Like usury, applying wet to wet,<BR>
Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall<BR>
Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of folded schedules had she many a one,<BR>
Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;<BR>
Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone<BR>
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<BR>
Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,<BR>
With sleided silk feat and affectedly<BR>
Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,<BR>
And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:<BR>
Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,<BR>
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!<BR>
Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'<BR>
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<BR>
Big discontent so breaking their contents.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--<BR>
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew<BR>
Of court, of city, and had let go by<BR>
The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--<BR>
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,<BR>
And, privileged by age, desires to know<BR>
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So slides he down upon his grained bat,<BR>
And comely-distant sits he by her side;<BR>
When he again desires her, being sat,<BR>
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:<BR>
If that from him there may be aught applied<BR>
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,<BR>
'Tis promised in the charity of age.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold<BR>
The injury of many a blasting hour,<BR>
Let it not tell your judgment I am old;<BR>
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:<BR>
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,<BR>
Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied<BR>
Love to myself and to no love beside.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'But, woe is me! too early I attended<BR>
A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--<BR>
Of one by nature's outwards so commended,<BR>
That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:<BR>
Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;<BR>
And when in his fair parts she did abide,<BR>
She was new lodged and newly deified.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;<BR>
And every light occasion of the wind<BR>
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.<BR>
What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:<BR>
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,<BR>
For on his visage was in little drawn<BR>
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<BR>
His phoenix down began but to appear<BR>
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin<BR>
Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:<BR>
Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;<BR>
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt<BR>
If best were as it was, or best without.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'His qualities were beauteous as his form,<BR>
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<BR>
Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm<BR>
As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,<BR>
When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.<BR>
His rudeness so with his authorized youth<BR>
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Well could he ride, and often men would say<BR>
'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:<BR>
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,<BR>
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop<BR>
he makes!'<BR>
And controversy hence a question takes,<BR>
Whether the horse by him became his deed,<BR>
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'But quickly on this side the verdict went:<BR>
His real habitude gave life and grace<BR>
To appertainings and to ornament,<BR>
Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:<BR>
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<BR>
Came for additions; yet their purposed trim<BR>
Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue<BR>
All kinds of arguments and question deep,<BR>
All replication prompt, and reason strong,<BR>
For his advantage still did wake and sleep:<BR>
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,<BR>
He had the dialect and different skill,<BR>
Catching all passions in his craft of will:<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'That he did in the general bosom reign<BR>
Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,<BR>
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<BR>
In personal duty, following where he haunted:<BR>
Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;<BR>
And dialogued for him what he would say,<BR>
Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Many there were that did his picture get,<BR>
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;<BR>
Like fools that in th' imagination set<BR>
The goodly objects which abroad they find<BR>
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;<BR>
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them<BR>
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,<BR>
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.<BR>
My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,<BR>
And was my own fee-simple, not in part,<BR>
What with his art in youth, and youth in art,<BR>
Threw my affections in his charmed power,<BR>
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<BR>
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;<BR>
Finding myself in honour so forbid,<BR>
With safest distance I mine honour shielded:<BR>
Experience for me many bulwarks builded<BR>
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil<BR>
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent<BR>
The destined ill she must herself assay?<BR>
Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,<BR>
To put the by-past perils in her way?<BR>
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;<BR>
For when we rage, advice is often seen<BR>
By blunting us to make our wits more keen.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,<BR>
That we must curb it upon others' proof;<BR>
To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,<BR>
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.<BR>
O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!<BR>
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,<BR>
Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'<BR>
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;<BR>
Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,<BR>
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;<BR>
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;<BR>
Thought characters and words merely but art,<BR>
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'And long upon these terms I held my city,<BR>
Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,<BR>
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,<BR>
And be not of my holy vows afraid:<BR>
That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;<BR>
For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,<BR>
Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''All my offences that abroad you see<BR>
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;<BR>
Love made them not: with acture they may be,<BR>
Where neither party is nor true nor kind:<BR>
They sought their shame that so their shame did find;<BR>
And so much less of shame in me remains,<BR>
By how much of me their reproach contains.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,<BR>
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,<BR>
Or my affection put to the smallest teen,<BR>
Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:<BR>
Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;<BR>
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,<BR>
And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,<BR>
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;<BR>
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me<BR>
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood<BR>
In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;<BR>
Effects of terror and dear modesty,<BR>
Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,<BR>
With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,<BR>
I have received from many a several fair,<BR>
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,<BR>
With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,<BR>
And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify<BR>
Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,<BR>
Whereto his invised properties did tend;<BR>
The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard<BR>
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;<BR>
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<BR>
With objects manifold: each several stone,<BR>
With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,<BR>
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,<BR>
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,<BR>
But yield them up where I myself must render,<BR>
That is, to you, my origin and ender;<BR>
For these, of force, must your oblations be,<BR>
Since I their altar, you enpatron me.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,<BR>
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;<BR>
Take all these similes to your own command,<BR>
Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;<BR>
What me your minister, for you obeys,<BR>
Works under you; and to your audit comes<BR>
Their distract parcels in combined sums.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,<BR>
Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;<BR>
Which late her noble suit in court did shun,<BR>
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;<BR>
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,<BR>
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,<BR>
To spend her living in eternal love.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave<BR>
The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,<BR>
Playing the place which did no form receive,<BR>
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?<BR>
She that her fame so to herself contrives,<BR>
The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,<BR>
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:<BR>
The accident which brought me to her eye<BR>
Upon the moment did her force subdue,<BR>
And now she would the caged cloister fly:<BR>
Religious love put out Religion's eye:<BR>
Not to be tempted, would she be immured,<BR>
And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!<BR>
The broken bosoms that to me belong<BR>
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,<BR>
And mine I pour your ocean all among:<BR>
I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,<BR>
Must for your victory us all congest,<BR>
As compound love to physic your cold breast.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,<BR>
Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,<BR>
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,<BR>
All vows and consecrations giving place:<BR>
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,<BR>
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,<BR>
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth<BR>
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,<BR>
How coldly those impediments stand forth<BR>
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!<BR>
Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,<BR>
'gainst shame,<BR>
And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,<BR>
The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,<BR>
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;<BR>
And supplicant their sighs to you extend,<BR>
To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,<BR>
Lending soft audience to my sweet design,<BR>
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath<BR>
That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,<BR>
Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;<BR>
Each cheek a river running from a fount<BR>
With brinish current downward flow'd apace:<BR>
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!<BR>
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses<BR>
That flame through water which their hue encloses.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies<BR>
In the small orb of one particular tear!<BR>
But with the inundation of the eyes<BR>
What rocky heart to water will not wear?<BR>
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?<BR>
O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,<BR>
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,<BR>
Even there resolved my reason into tears;<BR>
There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,<BR>
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;<BR>
Appear to him, as he to me appears,<BR>
All melting; though our drops this difference bore,<BR>
His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,<BR>
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,<BR>
Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,<BR>
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,<BR>
In either's aptness, as it best deceives,<BR>
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,<BR>
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'That not a heart which in his level came<BR>
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,<BR>
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;<BR>
And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:<BR>
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;<BR>
When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,<BR>
He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace<BR>
The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;<BR>
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,<BR>
Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.<BR>
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?<BR>
Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make<BR>
What I should do again for such a sake.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O, that infected moisture of his eye,<BR>
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,<BR>
O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,<BR>
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,<BR>
O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,<BR>
Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,<BR>
And new pervert a reconciled maid!'<BR>
