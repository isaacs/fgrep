<BLOCKQUOTE>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<BR>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<BR>
But then begins a journey in my head,<BR>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<BR>
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,<BR>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<BR>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<BR>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see<BR>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<BR>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<BR>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<BR>
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.<BR>
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<BR>
  For thee and for myself no quiet find.<BR>
