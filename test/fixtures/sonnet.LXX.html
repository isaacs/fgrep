<BLOCKQUOTE>That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,<BR>
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;<BR>
The ornament of beauty is suspect,<BR>
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.<BR>
So thou be good, slander doth but approve<BR>
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;<BR>
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<BR>
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.<BR>
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,<BR>
Either not assail'd or victor being charged;<BR>
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<BR>
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:<BR>
  If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,<BR>
  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.<BR>
