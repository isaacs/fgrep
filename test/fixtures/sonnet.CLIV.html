<BLOCKQUOTE>The little Love-god lying once asleep<BR>
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,<BR>
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep<BR>
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand<BR>
The fairest votary took up that fire<BR>
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;<BR>
And so the general of hot desire<BR>
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.<BR>
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,<BR>
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,<BR>
Growing a bath and healthful remedy<BR>
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,<BR>
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,<BR>
  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.<BR>
