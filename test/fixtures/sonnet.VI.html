<BLOCKQUOTE>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface<BR>
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:<BR>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place<BR>
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.<BR>
That use is not forbidden usury,<BR>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<BR>
That's for thyself to breed another thee,<BR>
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;<BR>
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,<BR>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<BR>
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,<BR>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<BR>
  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair<BR>
  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<BR>
